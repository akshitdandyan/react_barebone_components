# Contributing to React Barebones

We would love for you to contribute to react_barebone_components and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)

### Code of conduct
- Be kind to everyone here, help each other, we all are here for learning.
- Make sure your create quality pull requests and issues to get "hacktober-accepted" label, so that it will get counted in your hacktober profile and make you eligible to get goodies.
- Try building things from scratch, we will use near to negligible third party libraries so that we really understand how our project is working. However, if we ever feel that we have to use some other library we will do it.
- Feel free to take inspiration and help from web and other projects and think how we can improve and optimize it more.
- If you don't know ReactJs, you can still contribute by making icons, logo, documentation, graphic designing etc. These all will be counted as contribution in your profile for sure.

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/react_barebone_components) where the questions should be tagged with tag `react_barebone_components`.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to  Stack Overflow.

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?
If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can
[submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?
You can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to our GitHub
Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
a  for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a **Major Feature**, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be
discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,
and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Features** can be crafted and directly [submitted as a Pull Request](#submit-pr).
