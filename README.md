*Key points to be noticed while building new features or making improvements in existing components:*
 - a.) Add Reusable components under under src/components folder.
 - b.) If you have build a new component, make sure to showcase it in demo/demo.js file maintaining the stability with other components there.

After that you have made changes in code and tested all the things, just run basic git commands to push those changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "give-a-meaningful-message"
git checkout -b "branch-name" 
#keep branch name accordingly to work you have done, so it would be easier to manage pull requests
git push -u orign <branch-name"
```

- Now open your forked repository in github ui, there must be an alert informing you about your branch has commits. Click on the compare & pull request button, put  title and description accordingly, mention issue number if you were working on any pre defined issue.
-  Wait for the review of your pull request and you are all set to move further with it.
